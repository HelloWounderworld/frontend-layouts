# Solar System Simulator 2.0 Pure CSS

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/kingmeers/pen/YqyyrO](https://codepen.io/kingmeers/pen/YqyyrO).

I have done it again.. This time, using Haml and SCSS.

Version 1 was pretty filthy in terms of syntax, it was raw html and css, but now I just used algorithms to (hopefully) get everything pixel perfect. I added the glowing stars, which are really just circles 2x2 spawned in random positions increasing in opacity every couple of seconds.

Didn't think I'd be making another solar system, but after seeing how easy everything else was using a preprocessor, I thought why the hell not.

Also I finally worked out how to make the ring for saturn, also the moon is much better.
